## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Research and References

This project is grounded in extensive research across agricultural reports, government initiatives, agri-tech platforms, and AI-based solutions. Our aim is to build an inclusive, data-driven advisory system specifically for small and marginal farmers in India.
### 1. 📑 Government Reports & Policies
- [Soil Health Card Scheme – ICAR](https://soilhealth.dac.gov.in)
- [National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA)](https://nmsa.dac.gov.in)
- [Agricultural Census – Government of India](https://agcensus.nic.in)

### 2. 📱 Existing Agri-Tech Solutions Reviewed

| Platform         | Strengths                       | Gaps                                             |
|------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Plantix**      | Pest detection via images       | No voice support; limited local customization    |
| **mKisan**       | SMS alerts                      | Not interactive or AI-based                     |
| **Iffco Kisan**  | Market prices, advisory         | No smart recommendation system                  |
| **BharatAgri**   | Personalized plans              | Paid model; less suited for low-income farmers  |
| **Kisan Suvidha**| Government info + weather       | Outdated UI, lacks personalization              |

> Our solution combines these features and adds AI + multilingual voice support for better inclusivity.


### 3. 📂 Datasets Used

- [PlantVillage Dataset](https://plantvillage.psu.edu)
- [Soil Health Card Data (India)](https://data.gov.in)
- [IMD Weather Data](https://mausam.imd.gov.in)
- Fertilizer data from [KVK Manuals](https://kvk.icar.gov.in)

### 4. 🧠 Research Papers / AI Models

- “Crop Disease Detection using Deep Learning” – IEEE (2021)
- [IndicBERT – NLP for Indian Languages](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicNLP-Trans)
- Google Teachable Machine (for prototype image classification)

### 5. 🧑🏽‍🌾 Farmer Interviews (Primary Research)

> We interviewed smallholder farmers in Tamil Nadu & Kerala. Key findings:
> - 70% rely on word-of-mouth for crop advice
> - Most prefer audio or voice inputs (due to literacy barriers)
> - Limited awareness of agri-tech apps


### 6. 🧩 Why Existing Tools Fall Short

- No platform combines **image-based detection + soil-based advice + weather alerts + local language voice**
- Paid services limit adoption by marginal farmers
- Many government tools are **not user-friendly or AI-powered**
