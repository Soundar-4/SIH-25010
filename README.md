## Problem Title
SIH 25010: AI & IoT-Enabled Smart Greenhouse Monitoring System
## Problem Description
Many smallholder farmers struggle with inconsistent crop growth due to limited control over irrigation, temperature, and pest attacks. Traditional farming in open fields leaves crops vulnerable to unpredictable weather and water scarcity. Small-scale greenhouses can solve this, but farmers lack affordable, intelligent systems to manage them.  

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

A smart greenhouse monitoring system can help farmers:  
- Optimize water and fertilizer usage.  
- Reduce losses from pests and diseases.  
- Increase yield consistency.  
- Lower costs through automation.  
This contributes to **climate-resilient farming** and improved farmer income.  

Expected Outcomes

- IoT-based monitoring of soil moisture, humidity, and temperature.  
- AI-powered disease and pest detection using camera inputs.  
- Real-time irrigation/fertilizer recommendations.  
- Weather forecasts integrated with greenhouse control.  
- Multilingual voice and SMS alerts.  
- Data dashboard for farmers and extension officers.
  
Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

- Small and marginal farmers with greenhouse setups.  
- Agricultural cooperatives.  
- Agri-tech startups focusing on IoT.  
- State agriculture departments.
  
Supporting Data

- 40% of crop losses in India are due to **pest attacks and irregular irrigation** (ICAR, 2022).  
- FAO reports show that **greenhouse farming can increase productivity by 60%** with proper monitoring.  
- 78% of marginal farmers lack access to automated tools.

## Proposed Solution
We propose an **IoT + AI Smart Greenhouse Solution** where:  
- Sensors track soil and climate conditions in real time.  
- A mobile app provides personalized recommendations.  
- AI models analyze plant images for early disease detection.  
- Voice alerts in regional languages guide semi-literate farmers.  

## Technical Approach
- **Frontend:** React Native (Android/iOS)  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB / Firebase  
- **IoT:** Arduino/Raspberry Pi sensors for soil & environment data  
- **ML Models:** CNN for disease detection, LSTM for weather prediction  
- **APIs:** IMD weather API, Google Translate for multilingual support  


## Feasibility and Viability
- Hardware is affordable with open-source IoT boards.  
- Mobile penetration is high in rural India.  
- Offline-first design ensures usability in low-connectivity zones.
  
## Impact and Benefits
- Reduces water usage by 25â€“30%.  
- Prevents crop losses with early alerts.  
- Increases farmer income through higher yield.  
- Promotes eco-friendly and sustainable practices.
